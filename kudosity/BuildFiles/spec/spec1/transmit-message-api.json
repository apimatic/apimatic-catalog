Using them requires you to have URLs (https) configured on your account that can receive POST requests over the internet.\n\nThe `event_type` field is an enum that specifies which event to subscribe to:\n\n- LINK_HIT\n- OPT_OUT\n- MMS_STATUS\n- SMS_INBOUND\n- SMS_STATUS\n    \n\nFor status events, the nested `status` field is an enum with these values:\n\n- FAILED: Failed because of an error from the carrier or handset.\n    \n- SENT: Submitted to the carrier.\n- ACCEPTED: Accepted by the carrier and delivery may have been attempted (but is not confirmed).\n- DELIVERED: Delivered to handset.\n- SOFT_BOUNCE: Undeliverable due to handset being switched off, out of range or other temporary deliverability issue.\n- HARD_BOUNCE: Handset was disconnected.\n- OTHER: Any other status from the carrier.\n    \n\n## Link Hit\n\nThe `LINK_HIT` event is triggered any time a recipient visits a link that is tracked. Track Links is an optional flag on the send message API calls. Along with the URL that was being tracked is a hits field indicating how many visits this tracked link has in total and a source_message which contains the track link sent to the recipient.\n\n###### Example Payloads\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"LINK_HIT\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-05-06T05:19:42Z\",\n  \"link_hit\": {\n    \"hits\": 1,\n    \"url\": \"https://www.example.com/abc\",\n    \"source_message\": {\n      \"type\": \"MMS\",\n      \"id\": \"b50e4dc1-e57f-459c-a15c-526bee00a4c4\",\n      \"message\": \"Hey, Check this out! http://clckme.info/KYhSsuIH Opt-out reply STOP\",\n      \"message_ref\": \"D701\",\n      \"recipient\": \"61435790000\",\n      \"sender\": \"61481074191\",\n      \"subject\": \"Hello\",\n      \"content_urls\": [\n        \"https://res.cloudinary.com/burstsms/image/upload/v1618798563/284KB_qgqtbe.jpg\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"LINK_HIT\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-07-20T23:14:04Z\",\n  \"link_hit\": {\n    \"hits\": 1,\n    \"url\": \"https://www.example.com/abc\",\n    \"source_message\": {\n      \"type\": \"SMS\",\n      \"id\": \"faf68308-16cd-4cf9-aef7-47342bd405be\",\n      \"message\": \"Hey, Check this out! http://clckme.info/KYhSsuIH for Opt-out reply STOP or hit opt out link - http://nsub.me/vqHTcCsh \",\n      \"message_ref\": \"D301\",\n      \"recipient\": \"61435795809\",\n      \"sender\": \"61481074185\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n## Opt Out\n\nThe `OPT_OUT` event is triggered when a recipient has visited an opt-out link in a message they have received or by sending a message with the text \"STOP\".\n\nUsing parameter \\[opt-out-link\\] in message body, inserts the opt-out link.\n\nThe source field will be set according to the method a recipient has used to opt-out and contain a value of either link or SMS.\n\n> **Important:** Please make sure **You** exclude the opted out contacts from your future campaigns. To achieve high throughput, this API does **NOT** check against an Opt Out list before sending messages. \n  \n\n###### Example Payloads\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"OPT_OUT\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-05-06T05:16:20Z\",\n  \"opt_out\": {\n    \"source\": \"LINK_HIT\",\n    \"source_message\": {\n      \"type\": \"SMS\",\n      \"id\": \"a51ebe4e-a412-440e-a8d9-464e68a521cc\",\n      \"message\": \"Hey, Check this out! http://clckme.info/KYhSsuIH for Opt-out reply STOP or hit opt out link - http://nsub.me/vqHTcCsh\",\n      \"message_ref\": \"ncc5009d\",\n      \"recipient\": \"61435790000\",\n      \"sender\": \"61481074190\"  \n    }\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"OPT_OUT\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-05-06T05:16:20Z\",\n  \"opt_out\": {\n    \"source\": \"SMS_INBOUND\",\n    \"source_message\": {\n      \"type\": \"SMS\",\n      \"id\": \"a51ebe4e-a412-440e-a8d9-464e68a521cc\",\n      \"message\": \"Hey, Check this out! http://clckme.info/KYhSsuIH for Opt-out reply STOP or hit opt out link - http://nsub.me/vqHTcCsh\",\n      \"message_ref\": \"ncc5009d\",\n      \"recipient\": \"61435790000\",\n      \"sender\": \"61481074190\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n## MMS Status\n\nThe `MMS_STATUS` event data is posted to you for changes to an MMS message status. These are currently only comprised of internal statuses (SENT, FAILED).\n\n###### Example Payload\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"MMS_STATUS\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-05-06T05:19:33Z\",\n  \"status\": {\n    \"type\": \"MMS\",\n    \"id\": \"b50e4dc1-e57f-459c-a15c-526bee00a4c4\",\n    \"message_ref\": \"D7001\",\n    \"recipient\": \"61435790000\",\n    \"sender\": \"61481074191\",\n    \"status\": \"SENT\"\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n## SMS Inbound\n\nThe `SMS_INBOUND` event is posted to you on receipt of an SMS sent from a recipient to one of the senders listed on your account. For convenience we will try and find a message that you have sent to this recipient from that sender and supply it as the `last_message` field. This is useful for determining if an inbound message is potentially a reply. The `routed_via` field will display when a shared local number has been used to deliver your message.\n\n###### Example Payload\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"SMS_INBOUND\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-05-06T05:16:33Z\",\n  \"mo\": {\n    \"type\":\"SMS\",\n    \"id\": \"alss-2way-605b31c7-d2c49104\",\n    \"message\": \"Stop\",\n    \"recipient\": \"61481074190\",\n    \"routed_via\": \"447507333300\",\n    \"sender\": \"447507222200\",\n    \"last_message\": {\n      \"type\":\"SMS\",\n      \"id\": \"a51ebe4e-a412-440e-a8d9-464e68a521cc\",     \n      \"message\": \"Hey, check this out!\",\n      \"message_ref\": \"ncc5009d\",\n      \"recipient\": \"447507222200\",\n      \"routed_via\": \"447507333300\",\n      \"sender\": \"61481074190\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n## SMS Status\n\nThe `SMS_STATUS` event data is posted to you for changes to a SMS message status. Multiple status events can be triggered for a single message.\n\nThe `routed_via` field will display when a shared local number has been used to deliver your message.\n\n###### Example Payload\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"SMS_STATUS\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-05-06T05:16:07Z\",\n  \"status\": {\n    \"type\": \"SMS\",\n    \"id\": \"a51ebe4e-a412-440e-a8d9-464e68a521cc\",\n    \"message_ref\": \"ncc5009d\",\n    \"recipient\": \"447507222200\",\n    \"routed_via\": \"447507333300\",\n    \"sender\": \"61481074190\",\n    \"status\": \"SENT\"\n  }\n}\n\n ```"},{"name":"Conversr","description":"Conversr is an extension of Transmit that enables automated conversational SMS.
