      summary: This endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new domestic
        payment consent resource.
      description: The POST action indicates to the ASPSP that a domestic payment
        consent has been staged.  At this point, the PSU may not have been identified
        by the ASPSP, and the request payload may not contain any information of the
        account that should be debited. The endpoint allows the PISP to send a copy
        of the consent (between PSU and PISP) to the ASPSP for the PSU to authorise.
        The ASPSP creates the domestic payment consent resource and responds with
        a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.
