The initial goal of this end-point is to provide the caller (e.g. a merchant's web site) to list a client's accounts and balances as a part of the checkout and payment flow.\n"},{"name":"Charges","description":"To collect a payment for a good or service we first need to create a charge. A charge verifies that a given account has enough funds (the available balance) to pay for a purchase. If there are enough funds in an account the charge amount is placed in an authorised state for the funds to be captured by the merchant after the purchase has been fulfilled.\nFor convenience, the charge API allows the caller to both authorise and capture in a single request. This is to support situations where the goods being purchased are made available at the time the charge is created.\nCharges may remain in an authorised state, and the funds placed on hold, for a limited period of time. The timeframe is dependent upon your merchant agreement.\nFrom time to time it may be necessary to cancel a charge before the funds have been captured. For example, when a customer cancels an order prior to shipping. As no funds have been transferred out of the customer's account, the charge is marked as cancelled and the hold on funds is removed.\nIn the event that a charge has been captured, it is possible to refund an amount to the customer's account. The amount of a refund can be the same, more, or less than the amount of the captured amount.\n"},{"name":"Checkouts","description":"The Checkouts API allows a system to register detailed SKU-level information about what is being purchased. This is optional in the payment flow.\n"},{"name":"Healthcheck","description":"The Status API is here to notify the status of Linking and Charges services.\n"},{"name":"Identity","description":"The Identity API is responsible for generating OAuth tokens.\nThe [token] endpoint can generate different kinds of tokens based on the value of the [grant_type] parameter. To generate a new access token, id token, and refresh token for a user, the recommended value for parameter [grant_type] is [refresh_token].\n"},{"name":"Linking","description":"The Linking API is responsible for identifying the customer and to retrieve a token that represents the customer.\nThe first of the end-points that is being made available is for the customer identification.
