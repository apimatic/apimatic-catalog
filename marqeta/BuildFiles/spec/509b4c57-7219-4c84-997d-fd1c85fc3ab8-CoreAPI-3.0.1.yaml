        - Bulk Card Orders
    post:
      description: |-
        Use this endpoint to order physical cards in bulk.
        A new bulk card order creates new cards or users, generally within about a day.

        Before creating a bulk card order, set the `config.fulfillment.bulk_ship` field of the associated card product to `true`.

        *To associate all cards with the same user:*

        * Set `user_association.single_inventory_user=true`
        * Set `user_association.single_inventory_user_token` equal to the token of an existing user.

        The bulk card order automatically populates the database with the specified card objects.
        Values for the card `token` fields are generated in the format `card-numericPostfix`, where `numericPostfix` is a randomly generated number that is added for each new card that is generated.

        *To associate each card with a unique user:*

        Set `user_association.single_inventory_user=false`.
        Both the cards and their associated users are automatically generated.
        Values for the user `token` fields are generated in the format `user-numericPostfix`.
        The `numericPostfix` values for cards and their associated users match.
        This value is also printed on the physical cards if the `name_line_1_numeric_postfix` field is set to `true`.

        Use this endpoint to create a card product.

        The card product request contains a set of fields that provide basic information about the card product, such as name, active status, and start and end dates.
        Configuration information is contained in the `config` object, which contains sub-elements whose fields control the features and behavior of the card product.
        The elements are referred to collectively as the card product "configuration," and as such are contained in a `config` object.

        \ field (see <</core-api/card-products, Card Products>>).\n\nSend a `POST`\
        \ request to `/pins/controltoken` to set the card's PIN if your program requires\

        Retrieves the `user_token` and `card_token` for a PAN (card number).
        In the case of a reissued card, where multiple cards share the same PAN, the information for the most recently issued card is returned.

        This request is useful in IVR scenarios where a user has telephoned and identifies the card by the PAN.
        The retrieval of these tokens is implemented as a `POST` request because supplying the PAN in the request body is more secure than supplying it in the URL (as would be required with a `GET`).

        [WARNING]
        Sending a request to this endpoint requires PCI DSS compliance.
        You must comply with PCI DSS data security requirements if you want to store, transmit, or process sensitive card data such as the cardholder's primary account number (PAN), personal identification number (PIN), and card expiration date.

        Create an ACH funding source for an existing account holder.
        Specify the account holder of the funding source by passing a user or business token.

        When adding an ACH funding source, a small amount is deposited in the bank account as a test.
        The test deposit should be reflected in the account after two to three business days.
        You must then make an API call to verify the deposit amount in order to activate the ACH account.
        See <<verify_or_update_ach_source, Verify or Update ACH Funding Source>> on this page for more information.

        The response body returns details about the account, including the verification status.
        Possible ACH verification status values include `VERIFICATION_PENDING`, `ACH_VERIFIED`, and `ACH_FAILED`.

        Use this endpoint to request a peer transfer (i.e., a movement of funds from the GPA of an account holder to another account belonging to the same account holder).
        Add the source details to the body of the request in link:http://www.json.org/[JSON] format.

        When creating a peer transfer request, you must pass in both a token to identify the fee sender (either `sender_user_token` or `sender_business_token`) and a token to identify the fee recipient (either `recipient_user_token` or `recipient_business_token`).
        The sender and recipient objects must already exist.

        [NOTE]
        This feature is disabled by default and requires activation by Marqeta.   +
          +
        This feature enables you to transfer or reallocate funds where the `sender_*\_token` and the `recipient_*\_token` belong to the same account holder.
        It does not allow you to transfer or reallocate funds between different account holders.
        Contact your Marqeta representative for more information.

        To request an email verification token, send a `POST` request to the `/users/auth/verifyemail` endpoint.
        No input parameters are required because this operation is performed in the context of an authenticated user.
        This request generates and sends an email message containing the email verification token to the user's email address.

  /webhooks/{token}/ping:
    post:
      description: |-
        Pings webhook endpoint.

        Send a ping request to your webhook endpoint to validate credentials and connectivity.
        Your webhook endpoint must be configured to respond.

        *Configuring your webhook endpoint*

        This subsection describes the ping request that your webhook endpoint should expect and its expected response.

        When the Marqeta platform receives the ping request, it sends a `POST` request containing the following body to the URL of your webhook endpoint:

        [#ping-webhook-sample]
        [source,json]
        ----
        {
          "pings": [
            {
              "token": "marqeta",
              "payload": "healthcheck"
            }
          ]
        }
        ----

        To indicate that it is functioning properly, your webhook endpoint must respond with a status code of "200" (see <</developer-guides/signature-verification, Signature Verification>> for a code example that identifies a ping request).
        The response can optionally include a link:http://www.json.org/[JSON, window="_blank"]-formatted body, for example:

        [#ping-webhook-sample-2]
        [source,json]
        ----
        {"my_endpoint_status": "alive"}
        ----

        The Marqeta platform then responds to its requestor by echoing, as-is, the response code and body received from your webhook endpoint.

        *Using the ping facility*

        To ping a webhook endpoint, send a `POST` request to `/webhooks/{token}/ping` and use the `token` path parameter to specify the webhook to ping.
        Include an empty, JSON-formatted body in the request, that is:

        [#ping-webhook-sample-3]
        [source,json]
        ----
        {}
        ----

        The following chain of actions occurs during a successful ping:

        . The Marqeta platform receives the ping request (`POST` to `/webhooks/{token}/ping`).
        . The Marqeta platform sends a request to your webhook endpoint.
        . Your webhook endpoint responds with a status code of "200" and an optional body.
        . The Marqeta platform responds to its requestor by echoing, as-is, the response code and body received from your webhook endpoint.

        [NOTE]
        If the customer-hosted endpoint fails to respond within five seconds, the Marqeta platform times out the request and responds with the following message body (where `<optional message>` represents additional details you can choose to include in the response):

        [#ping-webhook-sample-4]
        [source,json]
        ----
        {
          "error_message": "Webhook operation failed " + <optional message>,
          "error_code": "422600"
        }
        ----

        Failed pings are not automatically retried.

            Ensure that the description you provide here adequately captures the kind of restriction exerted by this velocity control, because the Marqeta platform will send this information to you in a webhook in the event that the transaction authorization attempt is declined by the velocity control.

            *NOTE:* This field is very important.
            If your program has multiple velocity controls in place, it is not always clear which one prevented the transaction from being approved.
            Adding specific details to this field gives you more contextual information when debugging or monitoring declined authorization attempts.

            This token is necessary for use in other API calls, so we recommend that rather than let the system generate one, you use a simple string that is easy to remember.
