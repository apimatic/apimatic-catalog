{"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"description":"This is a formal specification of the Netspend API.\n\n## Authentication\nThe API uses OAuth 2.0 access token to authenticate API requests. API key and secret generated for the app in the portal will be used to create an access token. These access tokens are valid for 24 hours.\n| Environment | Access Token URL |\n| ------ | --------- |\n| Sandbox | https://apis-cert.netspend.com/netspend-api/v1/oauth/accesstoken |\n| Production | https://apis.netspend.com/netspend-api/v1/oauth/accesstoken |\nTo receive an access token, API clients will POST an API request to one of the above URLs with grant_type parameter set to client_credentials and content-type set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\nIt is recommended that the client ID and client secret from the registered app be passed in as base64 URL encoded string in the Authorization header. To do this a base64 encoding tool can be used to encode the two values together with colon separating them, client_id:client_secret.<br />\nThe API can be invoked using *curl* like below\n<pre><code>\ncurl -v -X POST \"https://apis-cert.netspend.com/netspend-api/v1/oauth/accesstoken\" \\\n -H \"Authorization: Basic eVFqQTQ2MWVWMjl6UUd3Tk9wZDBIenVZdVpGNXRJeko6WWgxVFY0b0FYYWN0YUhybQ==\" \\\n -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n -d \"grant_type=client_credentials\"\n</code></pre>\n<b>Sample Response</b>\n<pre><code>\naccess_token: OikMUkfZcv46jcAaiacJ4nHqXvxw\nexpires_in: 86399\ntoken_type: Bearer\nscope: owned_accounts_full\n</code></pre>\n\nPrevious methods of authentication have been deprecated, but are still included in this spec to allow for some transition.\n\n## Headers\nThe API supports the following headers on all API requests, in addition to the standard Authorization header:\n| Header | Required? | Description |\n| ------ | --------- | ----------- |\n| ns-request-id | Yes | UUID, generated by the client, which identifies the request |\n| ns-request-flow-id | No | Optional ID, generated by the client, used to group together multiple API calls for diagnostics |\n| ns-session-id | No | UUID, generated by createSession call, to identify a user in a server API call |\n| ns-location-id | No | Name of the partner's store location, if applicable |\n| ns-teller-id | No | Name of the teller at the partner's store location, if applicable |\n\nThe API also supports the following HTTP response headers:\n| Header | Required? | Description |\n| ------ | --------- | ----------- |\n| ns-response-id | Yes | Copy of the ns-request-id header from the request |\n| ns-duplicate-request | No | For any request that changes server data, \"true\" indicates this is a duplicate request, \"false\" indicates this is not a duplicate request, and missing indicates no idempotency detection was done |\n\n## HTTP Status Codes\nThe API may respond to any request with one of the following common HTTP status codes:\n| Code | Meaning | Description | Schema Object |\n| ---- | ------- |------------ | ------------- |\n| 400  | Bad Request | Information from the client was not presented to the API in a proper format | `#/components/schemas/BadRequestError` |\n| 401  | Unauthorized | The caller could not be successfully authenticated | `#/components/schemas/AuthenticationError` |\n| 403  | Forbidden | The caller is not authorized to interact with the target resource | `#/components/schemas/AuthorizationError` |\n| 405  | Method Not Allowed | The method received is not supported by the target resource | None | |\n| 409  | Conflict  | Idempotency conflict (read detailed message in response) | `#/components/schemas/IdempotencyError` |\n| 415  | Unsupported Media Type | The API currently only supports application/json type requests and responses | None |\n| 429  | Too Many Requests | (Reserved) The client has exceeded its maximum permitted request rate | Reserved |\n| 500  | System Error | The system has encountered an error from which it cannot recover |`#/components/schemas/SystemError` |\n| 503  | Service Unavailable | The system is temporarily unable to respond to requests | `#/components/schemas/ServiceUnavailableError` |\n\n## Idempotency\nThe API will detect duplicate requests that use the same ns-request-id header. This detection is limited to\nPUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests that can change system data. In the case where a duplicate request is detected\nthe original response will be replayed, and the ns-duplicate-request response header will have the value \"true\". However,\nin some cases if a duplicate ns-request-id is presented but the request details are different, a 409/Conflict response\nwill be returned.\n","version":"1.3.0","title":"Netspend API"},"tags":[{"name":"Authorization","description":"Management of authorization, including access tokens and client SDK tokens"},{"name":"Accounts","description":"Management of accounts"},{"name":"ACH","description":"Management of ACH and direct deposits"},{"name":"Agreements","description":"Management of agreements, including agreement details and subscriptions"},{"name":"Cards","description":"Management of physical, virtual, digital, and tokenized cards on an account"},{"name":"Digital Wallet Tokens","description":"Management of digital wallet tokens"},{"name":"Document Requests","description":"Management of documents for review and approval"},{"name":"External Bank Transfers","description":"Management of funds transfers to/from an external bank account"},{"name":"External Banks","description":"Management of external bank accounts"},{"name":"External Cards","description":"Management of external cards"},{"name":"External Card Transfers","description":"Management of external card transfers"},{"name":"Me to Me Card Payment","description":"Me to Me payments to and from an Account Owner's Debit Card"},{"name":"Metadata","description":"Information about the API itself"},{"name":"Overdraft","description":"Management of the overdraft feature"},{"name":"P2P","description":"Management of peer-to-peer transfers"},{"name":"Partner Authentication","description":"Partner access token generation"},{"name":"Partners","description":"Management of partners"},{"name":"Payback Rewards","description":"Management of an account's payback rewards"},{"name":"People","description":"Management of all individual persons on or related to an account"},{"name":"Referral Marketing","description":"Word-of-mouth marketing program for new customer acquisition"},{"name":"Remote Deposit Capture","description":"Management of remote deposit capture for check loads"},{"name":"Restrictions","description":"Management of account restrictions"},{"name":"Savings","description":"Management of savings accounts"},{"name":"Sessions","description":"Management of sessions"},{"name":"Statements","description":"Management of account statements"},{"name":"Subaccounts","description":"Management of Subaccounts"},{"name":"Transactions","description":"Mangement of financial transactions and authorizations"}],"security":[{"partnerToken":[]},{"oauthTokenSandbox":[]},{"oauthTokenProd":[]}],"servers":[{"url":"https://apis.netspend.com/netspend-api/v1","description":"Production server."},{"url":"https://apis-cert.netspend.com/netspend-api/v1","description":"Certification/sandbox environment server."},{"url":"https://api.netspend.com/public/v1","description":"Deprecated server.
