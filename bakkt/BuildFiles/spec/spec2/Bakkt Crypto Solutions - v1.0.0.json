The closed sublots represent closed lots that have been \"split\" and adjusted for wash sales.  Sublots have more complicated entity relationships and key associations versus the non-wash sale adjusted lots.  \n\nIn general, wash sales arise when shares are taxably disposed at a loss and within a period of 30 days before or after disposal substantially identical shares are acquired.  When a wash sale condition exists, the loss is disallowed, the basis of the acquired shares is increased by the amount of the disallowed loss, and the holding period of the acquired shares is adjusted to include the holding period of the shares sold.  \n\nSublots represent the portion of a lot to which a particular wash sale adjustment has been applied.  Since wash sales most often result from the interaction of loss and acquisition activity with un-equal share quantities, there may be one to many sublots per lot.  When a lot is partially adjusted, the remaining unadjusted shares are also represented as a sublot.  For consistency, the sublot-view also represents fully unadjusted lots as sublots.  There will therefore always be at least one sublot per lot.\n\nWhen lots are directly adjusted for wash sales, the intuitive relationships between transactions and lots is obscured and it frequently becomes impossible to discern how a particular set of lots (sublots) resulted from a given pattern of activity.  Account holders and client-service personnel will see little or no relationship between trading activity and the resulting lots (sublots).  To address this issue, the system maintains both lot and sublot views of open and closed lot information at all times.  \"openTagno\", \"closeTagno\", and \"closeSeqno\" are populated as in the sublots, but since lots may have been split into multiple sublots due to wash sales, identical key values may appear in multiple records.  To uniquely identify sublots, these keys must be combined with the sublot identifiers.\n\n\"closeSublotId\", a globally unique key for closed sublots, is provided as an alternate means to directly identify closed sublots.  This identifier is generated internally by the system.","properties":{"accountId":{"type":"string","x-order":7},"closeCommission":{"description":"Commission on disposal, prorated per QTY (0 for non-taxable disposals).","example":25,"format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":24},"closeCurrency":{"description":"Closing transaction currency ISO code.","example":"USD","type":"string","x-order":28},"closeDateTime":{"description":"End date of unadjusted holding period.","example":"2011-04-01","format":"date-time","type":"string","x-order":31},"closeFees":{"description":"Total fees on disposal, prorated per QTY (0 for non-taxable disposals).","example":".62","format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":25},"closeFxRate":{"description":"Closing transaction spot foreign exchange rate to USD.","example":1,"format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":29},"closeInterest":{"description":"Interest on disposal, prorated per QTY (0 for non-taxable disposals).","example":0,"format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":26},"closeIseType":{"description":"Closing transaction sub-type (indicates specific business event disposing this lot - list can be provided).","example":"Sell","type":"string","x-order":35},"closeNet":{"description":"Net proceeds (cost for shorts) of disposal, in indicated currency, exclusive of interest, adjusted for option premium paid or received, unadjusted for wash sales.","example":77525.62,"format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":27},"closeNetBase":{"description":"The net expressed in the account's base currency - adjusted using the closeFxRate.","example":77525.62,"format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":30},"closeOptionPremiumAdjustment":{"description":"Adjustment to closeNet due to premium paid or received, when lot closed via option exercise/assignment (0 when lot not disposed via option exercise/assignment).","example":0,"format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":46},"closePrice":{"description":"Execution price on disposal (0 for non-taxable disposals).","example":155.05124,"format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":23},"closeSeqno":{"description":"Sequence number of one to many closed lots generated by the closing transaction.

The open sublots represent lots that have been \"split\" and adjusted for wash sales.  Sublots have more complicated entity relationships and key associations versus the non-wash sale adjusted lots.  \n\nIn general, wash sales arise when shares are taxably disposed at a loss and within a period of 30 days before or after disposal substantially identical shares are acquired.  When a wash sale condition exists, the loss is disallowed, the basis of the acquired shares is increased by the amount of the disallowed loss, and the holding period of the acquired shares is adjusted to include the holding period of the shares sold.  \n\nSublots represent the portion of a lot to which a particular wash sale adjustment has been applied.  Since wash sales most often result from the interaction of loss and acquisition activity with un-equal share quantities, there may be one to many sublots per lot.  When a lot is partially adjusted, the remaining unadjusted shares are also represented as a sublot.  For consistency, the sublot-view also represents fully unadjusted lots as sublots.  There will therefore always be at least one sublot per lot.\n\nWhen lots are directly adjusted for wash sales, the intuitive relationships between transactions and lots is obscured and it frequently becomes impossible to discern how a particular set of lots (sublots) resulted from a given pattern of activity.  Account holders and client-service personnel will see little or no relationship between trading activity and the resulting lots (sublots).  To address this issue, the system maintains both lot and sublot views of open and closed lot information at all times.  \"openTagno\", \"closeTagno\", and \"closeSeqno\" are populated as in the sublots, but since lots may have been split into multiple sublots due to wash sales, identical key values may appear in multiple records.  To uniquely identify sublots, these keys must be combined with the sublot identifiers.\n\n\"openSublotId\", a globally unique key for open sublots, is provided as an alternate means to directly identify open sublots.  This identifier is generated internally by the system.","properties":{"accountId":{"type":"string","x-order":3},"averageCostIndicator":{"description":"Indicates average basis acquisition (\"false\" = CostBasis, \"true\" = AverageBasis).","example":false,"type":"boolean","x-order":19,"nullable":true},"commission":{"description":"Commission on original taxable acquisition or as reported on incoming transfer statement, prorated per QTY, adjusted via applicable ratios through all applied lot replacement and/or distribution processing.","example":50,"format":"decimal","type":"string","x-order":7},"coveredIndicator":{"description":"Indicates covered/noncovered status of shares disposed.","example":false,"type":"boolean","x-order":20,"nullable":true},"coveredReason":{"description":"Reason for covered/noncovered determination.","enum":["TransferStatement","Overrride","ExemptRecipient","ApplicableAcquisition"],"example":"ApplicableAcquisition","type":"string","x-order":21},"createdDatetime":{"description":"Timestamp of closed lot creation in the cost basis system.","example":"2011-03-03T14:00:00.000Z","format":"date-time","type":"string","x-order":46},"currency":{"description":"Opening transaction currency ISO code.","example":"USD","type":"string","x-order":11},"drpIndicator":{"description":"Indicates acquisition under dividend reinvestment plan (\"false\" = Non-DRP, \"true\" = DRP).
