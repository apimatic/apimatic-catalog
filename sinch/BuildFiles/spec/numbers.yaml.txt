      You can set up callback URLs to receive event notifications when your numbers are updated. 
    
      When delivering events the order is not guaranteed (for example, a failed event scheduled for retry will not block other events that were queued).

      The client's callback handler must implement the state machine that can decide what to do with _unexpected_ events, for example, "old" events or invalid state transitions. In these cases the handler could use the API to GET the latest state for the resource.

      The callback handler is expected to "ingest" the event and respond with 200 OK. The domain-specific business logic and processes should be executed outside of the callback request, as internal asynchronous jobs.

      You can also add an [HMAC encrypted secret](/docs/numbers/api-reference/numbers/tag/Callbacks/#tag/Callbacks/operation/UpdateCallbackConfiguration) which is used for hashing the payload and sending the hashed String via the `X-Sinch-Signature` header - that you can use to validate that an incoming request is secure.

      To use callbacks, add the following IP addresses to your allowlist:
      
      - 54.76.19.159
      - 54.78.194.39
      - 54.155.83.128

        Activate a phone number to use with SMS products, Voice products, or both. 
                      
        You'll use `smsConfiguration` to setup your number for SMS and `voiceConfiguration` for Voice. To setup for both, add both objects. See the dropdown menu (just under language selection) for code samples.

        Note: You cannot add both objects if you only need to configure one object. For example, if you only need to configure `smsConfiguration` for SMS messaging, do not add the `voiceConfiguration` object or it will result in an error.

        Update an active phone number. You can perform the following updates:
          
        * Update the name that displays for a customer by modifying the `displayName` parameter.
        * Unlink the number from an SMS service or campaign by updating the `smsConfiguration` configuration object. To unlink a number, submit the request with an empty string (`””`) in the service plan ID or campaign ID fields.
        * Before linking a number to a new service or campaign, it must be unlinked from any existing service or campaign. Then, link the number to a new SMS service or campaign by updating the service plan ID or campaign ID with the new desired value.
        * Update the Voice app to which the number is assigned by using the voiceConfiguration object.
          
        You can update both SMS and Voice in the same object by including both configuration objects. If you only need to update either Voice or SMS, simply omit the other object. If you pass an empty configuration object, the request will fail.
