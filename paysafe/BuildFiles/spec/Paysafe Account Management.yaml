    # Overview

    The Paysafe Account Management API allows our Platform Partners to create their own white-labelled merchant on-boarding experience, via a set of REST-based calls. With this API, Platform Partners will be able to tailor their user experience to their business, using client information that they have already collected and verified.

    Once a merchant application has been received, Paysafe will quickly enable the merchant to accept payments using the payment method selected. The result of improved merchant experiences will be higher on-boarding conversion and increased processing volumes.


    # Authentication

    In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system
    and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:

    * Key ID – PartnerXYZ

    * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

    The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:

    1. The Key ID and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key ID:Key Password”.

    2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.

    3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

    For example, using the Key ID and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

    `Authorization: Basic
    UGFydG5lclhZWjpCLXRzdDEtMC01MWVkMzllNC0zMTJkMDIzNDVkM2YxMjMxMjA4ODFkZmY5YmI0MDIwYTg5ZThhYzQ0Y2RmZGNlY2Q3MDIxNTExODJmZGM5NTIyNzI2NjFkMjkwYWIyZTU4NDllMzFiYjAzZGVlZGU3ZQ==`

    For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

    **Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that they are used appropriately for your needs.

    # URLs

    ##  Test URL

    In order to test your integration with Paysafe, use the following Test URL:

    `https://api.test.paysafe.com`

    For example:

    `https://api.test.paysafe.com/accountmanagement/v1/merchants/{merchant_id}`

    ## Production URL

    In order to process live requests with Paysafe, use the following Production URL:

    `https://api.paysafe.com`

    For example:

    `https://api.paysafe.com/accountmanagement/v1/merchants/{merchant_id}`


    # Pagination

    In the case where an API GET request returns multiple results, Paysafe returns the first 10 records by default and uses HATEOAS links to provide page navigation. In addition to the default behavior, it is also possible to control the number of results and starting point by passing in query parameters  as described in this [section](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/support/reference-information/pagination/).


    # Global Invalid Characters

    You must not include any of the characters in this [table](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/support/reference-information/global-invalid-characters/) as values in any of your request parameters. Object. If you do, your request will result in an error.


    # ISO Standards

    ISO standards add value by providing the common business process data semantics to be used in the API based exchanges. This [section](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/support/reference-information/iso-standards/) presents you codes for four areas - Currency, Province, State, and Country.


    # HATEOAS

    The Account Management API uses a RESTful endpoint structure and relies on HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
    to determine what action you are attempting to perform on a specific resource.

    Each API call response includes an array of HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) links. 
    These links can be used to integrate subsequent flows and typically they will provide you information as to
    what you can do next.  Additionally these links might be used to link to other resources related to the
    current response object.

    By using these links, you no longer need to hardcode your integration to call specific endpoint URLs to utilize
    our API, but rather you can use the returned URL for the specific purpose as defined by the *rel* definition.

    ## HATEOAS Link Structure

    |Element  |Description|
    |---      |---|
    |rel      |Link relation that describes how this link relates to the previous call. Examples include *self* (get details of the current call), *next* (navigate to the next set of resources), or a related call.|
    |href     |URL of the related HATEOAS link you can use for subsequent calls.|

    Below are sample HATEOAS links from an API response that returns a collection of subaccounts associated to a specific merchant account. Links
    are provided to navigate through the set of resources in the collection.

    ```
    GET https://api.paysafe.com/accountmanagement/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/subaccounts&limit=10&offset=10
     
    ...result set
     
    "links": [{
        "rel": "self",
        "href": "https://api.test.paysafe.com/accountmanagement/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/subaccounts&limit=10&offset=10"
    },  {
        "rel": "prev",
        "href": "https://api.test.paysafe.com/accountmanagement/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/subaccounts&limit=10&offset=0"
    }, {
        "rel": "next",
        "href": "https://api.test.paysafe.com/accountmanagement/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/subaccounts&limit=10&offset=20"
    }]
    ```

    ## Tool Tips

    To create the best on-boarding experience, Paysafe suggests that you include some tool tips within your form to help users. The following tool tips are used within our own on-boarding form.

    **User Name**

    * Must be from 2 to 64 characters long
    * Can contain both alphabetical and numeric characters
    * Must contain all lowercase characters
    * Can contain the following special characters: period, comma, hyphen, underscore, and parentheses

    For example: merchant_com_24

    **Password**

    * Must be at least 8 characters long
    * Must combine both alphabetical and numeric characters (e.g., J8k9b3p)
    * Must contain at least one uppercase and one lowercase character
    * Must contain at least one special character (e.g., ~¡-ÿ!@#$%^&*(){}`_,+=?;:.[]/\)

    For example: Pay5@f3_999

    # Using the Console Window

    To configure and test the example in the Console window, click **Switch to Console**. 
    In the Console window, you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint. 
    For example, for many requests you must update the endpoint to include your account ID (returned when you create an account), which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the **account_id** value. 
    You must also update the Header to include your API Key, which you do by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value. 
    To get your API key User name and Password, log into the Paysafe Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**. 
    To then generate the API Key, concatenate your User name and Password, separated by a colon, then Base64 encode it, and then prefix it with "Basic ".
    When you are ready to test your example, you can switch between the Production and Mock server environment:

    * Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system.

    * Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your profile ID or Test API key for this request.

    To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.

        #### Mandatory Merchant Account Elements

        When you create a merchant account, only the following elements are mandatory:

        - name

        - currency

        - region

        - legalEntity

        - productCode

        This is to make the account creation requirements as minimal as possible. However, before you can [activate the merchant account](../operations/activate-a-merchant-account), the following elements are required and you must [update the merchant account](../operations/update-merchant-account-put) to include them:

        - category

        - phone

        - yearlyVolumeRange

        - averageTransactionAmount

        - merchantDescriptor

        **Note:** The *merchantDescriptor* is itself an object that contains two elements – *dynamicDescriptor* and *phone* – both of which are mandatory.

        In addition, depending on the jurisdiction in which you are boarding merchants, one of the following objects is also mandatory before you can activate the merchant account:

        - Canada – *caAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - United States – *usAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - Europe – *euAccountDetails*, for which *type* is mandatory, and *registrationNumber* is mandatory **unless** the value for *type* is set to one of TRUST, SOLEPROP, GOV, or PARTNERSHIP (in which case *registrationNumber* is optional)

        This is how you submit a merchant account creation request that includes the merchant account address.

        You must create a different merchant account (each with its unique *productCode*) for each payment method/currency combination you want to offer – e.g., credit card USD, Direct Debit EFT, etc.

        **Note:** You should wait 5 seconds before using the *id* returned in the merchant account creation response in any subsequent API call that requires it in the endpoint (e.g., updating the merchant account).

        #### Mandatory Merchant Account Elements

        When you create a merchant account, only the following elements are mandatory:

        - name

        - currency

        - region

        - legalEntity

        - productCode

        This is to make the account creation requirements as minimal as possible. However, before you can [activate the merchant account](../operations/activate-a-merchant-account), the following elements are required and you must [update the merchant account](../operations/update-merchant-account-put) to include them:

        - category

        - phone

        - yearlyVolumeRange

        - averageTransactionAmount

        - merchantDescriptor

        **Note:** The *merchantDescriptor* is itself an object that contains two elements – *dynamicDescriptor* and *phone* – both of which are mandatory.

        In addition, depending on the jurisdiction in which you are boarding merchants, one of the following objects is also mandatory before you can activate the merchant account:

        - Canada – *caAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - United States – *usAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - Europe – *euAccountDetails*, for which *type* is mandatory, and *registrationNumber* is mandatory **unless** the value for *type* is set to one of TRUST, SOLEPROP, GOV, or PARTNERSHIP (in which case *registrationNumber* is optional)

        #### Mandatory Merchant Account Elements

        When you create a merchant account, only the following elements are mandatory:

        - name

        - currency

        - region

        - legalEntity

        - productCode

        This is to make the account creation requirements as minimal as possible. However, before you can [activate the merchant account](../operations/activate-a-merchant-account), the following elements are required and you must [update the merchant account](../operations/update-merchant-account-put) to include them:

        - category

        - phone

        - yearlyVolumeRange

        - averageTransactionAmount

        - merchantDescriptor

        **Note:** The *merchantDescriptor* is itself an object that contains two elements – *dynamicDescriptor* and *phone* – both of which are mandatory.

        In addition, depending on the jurisdiction in which you are boarding merchants, one of the following objects is also mandatory before you can activate the merchant account:

        - Canada – *caAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - United States – *usAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - Europe – *euAccountDetails*, for which *type* is mandatory, and *registrationNumber* is mandatory **unless** the value for *type* is set to one of TRUST, SOLEPROP, GOV, or PARTNERSHIP (in which case *registrationNumber* is optional)

        This is how you update a merchant account and its associated merchant account address with a PATCH request.

        **Note:** While doing an update via a PATCH operation, you must provide only the elements of the merchant account that you want to update. Elements not included will remain unchanged in the resulting merchant account.

        #### Mandatory Merchant Account Elements

        When you create a merchant account, only the following elements are mandatory:

        - name

        - currency

        - region

        - legalEntity

        - productCode

        This is to make the account creation requirements as minimal as possible. However, before you can [activate the merchant account](../operations/activate-a-merchant-account), the following elements are required and you must [update the merchant account](../operations/update-merchant-account-put) to include them:

        - category

        - phone

        - yearlyVolumeRange

        - averageTransactionAmount

        - merchantDescriptor

        **Note:** The *merchantDescriptor* is itself an object that contains two elements – *dynamicDescriptor* and *phone* – both of which are mandatory.

        In addition, depending on the jurisdiction in which you are boarding merchants, one of the following objects is also mandatory before you can activate the merchant account:

        - Canada – *caAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - United States – *usAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - Europe – *euAccountDetails*, for which *type* is mandatory, and *registrationNumber* is mandatory **unless** the value for *type* is set to one of TRUST, SOLEPROP, GOV, or PARTNERSHIP (in which case *registrationNumber* is optional)

        This is how you look up a merchant account using the account ID returned in the response to the account creation request to return the merchant account information along with additional resources that have been added to the account.

        #### Mandatory Merchant Account Elements

        When you [create a merchant account](../operations/create-a-merchant-account), only the following elements are mandatory:

        - name

        - currency

        - region

        - legalEntity

        - productCode

        This is to make the account creation requirements as minimal as possible. However, **before you can activate the merchant account**, the following elements are required and you must [update the merchant account](../operations/update-merchant-account-put) to include them:

        - category

        - phone

        - yearlyVolumeRange

        - averageTransactionAmount

        - merchantDescriptor

        **Note:** The *merchantDescriptor* is itself an object that contains two elements – *dynamicDescriptor* and *phone* – both of which are mandatory.

        In addition, depending on the jurisdiction in which you are boarding merchants, one of the following objects is also mandatory before you can activate the merchant account:

        - Canada – *caAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - United States – *usAccountDetails*, for which *type* and *federalTaxNumber* are mandatory elements

        - Europe – *euAccountDetails*, for which *type* is mandatory, and *registrationNumber* is mandatory **unless** the value for *type* is set to one of TRUST, SOLEPROP, GOV, or PARTNERSHIP (in which case *registrationNumber* is optional)

        This is how you submit a merchant account activation request.

        **Note:** When the merchant account is successfully activated, Paysafe sends a confirmation email to the email address that was included in the [user creation](../operations/create-a-user) request.

      summary: Create a Microdeposit
      description: |-
        **Note:** [Microdeposits are not supported](../operations/create-a-microdeposit) for bank accounts associated with subaccounts.

        Before Paysafe can remit funds to a merchant, their bank account information must first be validated to verify that the applicant is in fact the owner of the bank account associated with the merchant account, and that the banking information provided is accurate. The bank account validation method varies by jurisdiction and bank scheme.

        |Jurisdiction   |Bank Account Type  |Validation Method      |
        |---            |---                |---                    |
        |UK             |BACS/SEPA/Wire     |- Voided Check, or<br/> - Bank Statement, or<br/> - Paying-in Slip, or<br/> - Letter from Bank Confirming Account Name, Account Number, and Sort Code |
        |EU             |SEPA/Wire          |- Bank Statement, or<br/> - Letter from Bank Confirming Account Name, IBAN, BIC, and Swift Code| 
        |US             |ACH                |- Verification through GIACT, or<br/> - Voided Check, or<br/> - Letter from Bank Confirming Bank Account Details|
        |CA             |EFT                |- Microdeposit, or<br/> - Voided Check, or<br/> - Letter from Bank Confirming Bank Account Details|
        For microdeposits, Paysafe will attempt to make a small deposit between 0.01 and 0.99 into the merchant's bank account, using the banking information they provided during sign-up. By identifying this amount and returning it to Paysafe, you validate that the merchant provided accurate bank account data.

        **Note:** If the microdeposit validation method fails for some reason, then the merchant must use one of the alternative validation methods.

        This is how you create a microdeposit request for an ACH (U.S.) or EFT (Canadian) bank account.

        Note: If the microdepost creation request fails (e.g., due to invalid bank account details), Paysafe sends a notification email to the email address that was included in the user creation request.

        You can create only one microdeposit request for each bank account. In addition, you can create a microdepost request only for merchant accounts with one of the following statuses:
          
          * PROCESSING
          * DEFERRED
          * APPROVED
          * ENABLED

        This is how you create a microdeposit validation request.

        As a result of a successful microdeposit request, a small deposit (between .01 and .99 of the currency of that account) is made to the bank account. To validate the microdeposit, you must send a microdeposit validation request that contains the exact amount of the microdeposit in the applicant's bank account. This verifies that the applicant is the owner of the bank account associated with the merchant account, and that the banking information provided is accurate.

        **Warning:** Only three attempts are permitted for submitting the microdeposit amount. After three failed attempts, the validation is considered as having failed.

        For microdeposits, Paysafe will attempt to make a small deposit between 0.01 and 0.99 into the merchant's bank account, using the banking information they provided during sign-up. By identifying this amount and returning it to Paysafe, you validate that the merchant provided accurate bank account data.

        **Note:** If the microdeposit validation method fails for some reason, then the merchant must use one of the alternative validation methods.

        This is how you look up a microdeposit to view its status.

        Subaccounts allow merchants to share and distribute payments among multiple accounts. 
        When you create a subaccount, it will be connected with the merchant account ID that is specified in the request endpoint.

        Not all merchant account types support subaccounts. Contact your account manager for more information.

        This is how you create a [subaccount](/schemas/subAccount).

        You must first create either an [EFT bank account](../operations/create-an-eft-bank-account-for-subaccounts) or an [ACH bank account](../operations/create-an-ach-bank-account-for-subaccounts) &ndash; depending on the processing region of the merchant account from which this subacccount is being created &ndash; that you will associate with this subaccount. 
        The *id* returned in the response to the destination bank account creation request will be used as the *eftId* or *achId* element in this request. 
        Note that the *id* can be used in multiple subaccount creation requests.

        **Note:** [Microdeposits are not supported](../operations/create-a-microdeposit) for bank accounts associated with subaccounts.

        Subaccounts allow merchants to share and distribute payments among multiple accounts. 
        When you create a subaccount, it will be connected with the merchant account ID that is specified in the request endpoint.

        Not all merchant account types support subaccounts. Contact your account manager for more information.

        You can disable a single subaccount by [updating the subaccount](../operations/update-a-subaccount) and changing its status to DISABLED. 
        With this request, however, you can disable all [subaccounts](/schemas/subAccount) belonging to a merchant account.

        **Note:** When using the PATCH operation, you must provide only the elements of the subaccount that you want to update. Elements not included will remain unchanged in the resulting subaccount.

      summary: Look Up a Debit Transfer
      description: |-
        Platform Partners can transfer balances between their linked merchants and their own account using the  Balance Transfer capability. For example, the Platform Partner may want to issue a merchant with credit as a part of a promotion. 
        To be able to perform transfers, Paysafe Technical Support configures the Platform Partner account with the capability, which enables it to transfer balances with all its linked merchants. 
        To be able to transfer balances, the Platform Partner must first be linked to the other accounts during onboarding, and only accounts settling in the same currency can be linked. 
        Balances can be transferred from only one account to another at a time, and the transfer amount cannot exceed the positive balance of the source account.

        This is how you look up a debit transfer.
