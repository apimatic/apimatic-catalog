[Click here to see an overview](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/additional-documentation/customer-identity-checks/getting-started/introduction-to-the-paysafe-customer-identity-api//) of how this API works.\n\n<a name=\"apikey\" title=\"Authentication\"></a>\n\n# Authentication\n\nIn order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:\n\n* Key Username – MerchantXYZ\n\n* Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e\n\nNote that this is not the same as your Merchant Back Office username and password.\nThe case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:\n\n1. The Key Username and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key Username:Key Password”.\n\n2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.\n\n3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, using the Key Username and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:\n\n``Authorization: Basic\nTWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=``\n\nFor additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).\n\n**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.\n\n# URLs\n\n##  Test URL\n\nIn order to test your integration with Paysafe, use the following Test URL:\n\n`https://api.test.paysafe.com`\n\nFor example:\n\n`https://api.test.paysafe.com/customeridentification/v1/identityprofiles`\n\n## Production URL\n\nIn order to process live requests with Paysafe, use the following Production URL:\n\n`https://api.paysafe.com`\n\nFor example:\n\n`https://api.paysafe.com/customeridentification/v1/identityprofiles`\n\n<a name=\"globalinvalidcharacters\" title=\"Global Invalid Characters\"></a>\n\n# Global Invalid Characters\n\nYou must not include any of the characters in the following table as values in any of your request parameters. If you do, your request will result in an error.\n\n|    Character    |    HEX    |    Description                     |\n|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------------|\n| \"               | 22        | Double quotes (or speech marks)    |\n| ;               | 3B        | Semicolon                          |\n| ^               | 5E        | Caret, circumflex                  |\n| *               | 2A        | Asterisk                           |\n| <               | 3C        | Less than (or open angled bracket) |\n| /               | 2F        | Slash or divide                    |\n| [               | 5B        | Opening bracket                    |\n| ]               | 5D        | Closing bracket                    |\n| \\               | 5C        | Backslash                          |\n\n# API\n\nThe Customer Identity API allows merchants to process KYC (know your customer) Customer Identity checks on their customers using the REST protocol. The protocol uses JSON for all requests and responses. The following request types are supported:\n\n* [Customer Identity Checks](/operations/RunaCustomerIdentityCheck)\n\n* [Rerun Failed Customer Identity Checks](/operations/RerunaCustomerIdentityCheck)\n\n**API Endpoints**\n\n- `https://api.paysafe.com/customeridentification/v1/identityprofiles`\n\n- `https://api.paysafe.com/customeridentification/v1/identityprofiles/customer_identity_id/rerunfailedchecks`\n\n**Resource Patterns**\n\n|Endpoint URL                                       |Description                            |Action |\n|---                                                |---                                    |---    |\n|/identityprofiles                                      |Run a Customer Identity Check on a Customer         |POST   |\n|/identityprofiles/{customer_identity_id}/rerunfailedchecks  |Rerun a Failed Customer Identity Check              |POST   |\n\n# Testing Instructions\n\nThe Paysafe Test environment can be used to test applications without running transactions through the Production (live) system. Requests processed in the Test environment are not sent to live downstream providers, but through a simulator. Depending on the information provided with the transaction request, the simulator returns either a successful (approved) or failed (declined) response.\n\nWith the Paysafe API you can test the following:\n\n* Verify support for all the operation types that you require.\n\n* Review all common errors as well as errors that may occur for each operation, and ensure your application can handle them.\n\n* Verify the lengths and format for all attributes you send.\n\n<a name=\"isostandards\" title=\"ISO Standards\"></a>\n\n# ISO Standards\n\n<a name=\"provincecodes\" title=\"Province

To get your API key, log in to the test version of the Merchant Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**.\n\nClick **View Base 64 Encoded** and copy the key to your clipboard. Paste the key after the word Basic to replace the text YOUR-BASE64-ENCODED-API-KEY.\nWhen you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:\n\n* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system.\n\n* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.\n\nTo call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.\n\n# Legal and Community\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.paysafe.com/paysafegroup/privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/terms-of-use/\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Use</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.paysafe.com/paysafegroup/regulatory-disclosures/\" target=\"_blank\">Regulatory Disclosures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://community.paysafe.com/spaces/11/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">FAQs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://community.paysafe.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Community</a></li>\n</ul>"
