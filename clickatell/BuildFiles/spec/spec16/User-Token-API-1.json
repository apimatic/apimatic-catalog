  description: >-
    The Token Lookup API may be used by clients to look up tokens/vouchers to
    present back to the 

    buyer/customer who purchased token related products via the Transact
    platform. This is an alternative way for 

    the buyers to view their purchased tokens/vouchers and will mainly be used
    if they did not receive the original 

    SMS containing the purchased token
